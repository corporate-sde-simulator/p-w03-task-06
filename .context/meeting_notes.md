# Meeting Notes - Sprint 25 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Amit Desai (Lead), Meera, Intern

---

## Database migration rollback engine

- **Amit Desai:** This is blocking our release. Meera started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Meera:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `migrationEngine.py` and `rollbackManager.py`
- [ ] @Meera - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Amit Desai - Final sign-off before merge
